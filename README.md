This is a project
We clone a repository and this is how we will get local copy of project code.


Then we make a branch on top of default branch - main/master


Every branch will be having two areas - 1. normal area 2. staging area


We make changes int the normal are and then we try to move it to staging area.(git add filename)


The we commit all the changes present in the staging area(git commit -m ""commit message").


After that we push all those commits which means changes will be visible on the remote repository.


You need to raise/create pull request. Now everyone in your team will review those changes.


And after review, someone will approve it and after it gets approved, you can merge this in default(main/master) branch.
